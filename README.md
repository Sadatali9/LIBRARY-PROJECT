# Library Management System

Welcome to the Library Management System!

This project is a simple Python program designed to manage a library's inventory. It allows users to add, display, count, search, check out, and return books.

**Features
**
Add a new book to the library
Display the entire library and its contents
Count the number of books in the library
Search for a book by title, author, or publication year
Check out a book (marks it as "CHECKED OUT")
Return a book (marks it as "AVAILABLE")
**Getting Started**

Clone this repository to your local machine.
Run the main() function to start the program.
Follow the prompts to perform one of the available actions.
**Note**

The program uses a simple text-based interface. Enter your choices by typing the corresponding number.
The program uses a list-based data structure to store book information.
The program does not currently support user authentication or data persistence (i.e., it will lose data when the program is closed).

This project was created by Sadat Ali.

**Future Development
**
This is a basic implementation, and there are many ways to improve it. Some potential features to consider adding include:

User authentication and authorization
Data persistence (e.g., using a database)
More advanced search functionality (e.g., searching by keyword or genre)
Support for multiple libraries or branches
I hope you enjoy using this program! Let me know if you have any questions or suggestions.
